        <h1>About</h1>
        <p></p>Hi, I'm ≈Åukasz and I'm a young inventor from Poland. This site is dedicated to one of my projects - <strong>Humming Hawk</strong>.<br>
        This project has on purpose creating ideal UAV for hacking(mainly red teaming) purposes. In my concept it must be stealth, durable 
        and efficient drone that can spend in air a lot of time. It will be a fully modular drone - I mean by that if I want to intercept the radio transmission
        I connect the right module for that and it works. Of course you can connect more than one module but if you don't want to map wifi networks why would you waste 
        space and battery on it.</p>
        <p></p>Main functions of the drone (at this moment):
        <ul>
            <li>Recon</li>
            <li>War flying</li>
            <li>RF hacking</li>
            <li>Jamming</li>
            <li>Capturing WPA handshakes, PMKIDs</li>
            <li>Scanning networks</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
        <i>I am not responsible for any legal issues if the drone is used incorrectly. If something is illegal just don't do it. These features are just a concept for now and I'm not going to do things that are illegal in my country. Never hack any infrastructure without proper permission. The project is intended for people who work in the hacking industry and have permission to use the drone's functionality.</i>
        </p>
        I think it's a project for months if not a years so the hard work awaits me. I dont have much money for it so I would be greatful for any financial support.
        This site will mainly serve as an update log of the project.</p>
